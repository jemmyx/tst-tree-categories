For one of my React application, I have to build a menu on top of items container to split them according their use.
So start to prototype this categories menu by implementing a first draft of the categories structure.

Work in progress, graph nodes needs to enahnced and optimized in terms of search.

This runs for the moment in interactive mode, simply run:

```
node ./app.js
```
